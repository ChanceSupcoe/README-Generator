## Description
This project was developed to help facilitate the creation of a professional README file using command-line prompts.

The project was built for the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp.

The command-line prompts direct the creation of a README file that contains a description of the project, a table of contents, installation instructions, usage instructions and examples, credits to other contributors or tutorials, licenses, tests, and how to reach the creator for additional questions. 

This project taught me how to make a proper README file with all needed content, along with bolstering my confidence using node.js.
